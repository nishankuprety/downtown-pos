# Logo Setup Instructions

To add your restaurant logo as a background:

1. Place your logo image file in this folder: `frontend/public/data/`
2. Rename it to: `logo.jpeg`
3. The background will show at 30% transparency (70% white overlay)

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPEG or PNG (must be named logo.jpeg)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- File size: Under 2MB for faster loading

If you don't want a background image:
- Simply don't add the logo.jpeg file
